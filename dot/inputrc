# === USABILITY ===
# Only require one <TAB> to show completions
set show-all-if-ambiguous on
# I don't like readline's pager
set page-completions off
# allow us to override e.g. ctrl-w with our own special chars
set bind-tty-special-chars off

# === BINDINGS ===
# The default control-w (unix-word-rubout) doesn't stop at slashes, which
# makes it way too aggressive.
Control-w: backward-kill-word
